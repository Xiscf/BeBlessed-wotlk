# BeBlessed-wotlk

From the work of Janniie - Stormreaver EU

Some bug remains.
Specially if you have glyphs that extend the duration of Bleesing of King and Blessing of Wisdowm.

Special thanks to Dairmaith - Sulfuron - Ally.

BeBlessed
BeBlessed in an AddOn that keeps track of your Blessing while solo and in a party. It also allows you to cast the correct blessing by clicking the button associated with each party member.

Usage
In order to assign a buff to a player, hold the mouse over the window associated with that player and use the scroll wheel to cycle through the available buffs.
Buffing is done by pressing the button associated with each party member
If the timer displays "buffed" in yellow text another paladin has already blessed that party member with the buff you just selected, so better select another one!
The AddOn can be moved by dragging the "BeBlessed" text on top of the window.
